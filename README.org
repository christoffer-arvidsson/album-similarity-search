* Pitchfork album similarity search
A prototype for searching for albums with text. The search currently
uses sentences from pitchfork reviews and a sentence transformer
embedding model to embed each sentence. For ease of use, FAISS is used
for nearest-neighbor search, although this is so far just an
exhaustive search.

Improvements:
- Aggregate embeddings for an entire review instead of per sentence search
